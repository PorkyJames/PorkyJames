# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a motivated student at App-Academy and am based in the Monterey County, California. 
I have a BA in Political Science with a Concentration in Pre-Law and previously worked two prestigious Immigration Law firms as a Paralegal.

Some of my interests include exploring new cities, snowboarding, rock climbing, and reading. I love picking up new hobbies and learning new skills as well!
